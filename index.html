      <p class="actual-hero-subtitle">
        A rugged badge worn by workers and BLE tags on equipment create a continuous, verifiable record of time, location, and tool usage — without any manual data entry. No phones, no forms, no apps. The badge captures what happens. The cloud makes it usable. Payroll, job costing, and scheduling get the truth.

        <h2 class="actual-card-title">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          The way time and tool use are tracked in the field today takes more effort than it should and still leaves gaps. Paper timesheets depend on workers remembering to fill them out. Phone apps assume coverage, battery, and willingness. Vehicle GPS can show where a truck went but not what the worker actually did.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          The result: payroll cleans up mistakes, supervisors chase down missing hours, and managers don't get a clear view until the week is over. Every downstream decision — billing, job costing, scheduling, estimating — starts on shaky ground.

        <h2 class="actual-card-title">What Changes</h2>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>Crews</strong> — Wear the badge. Skip the timesheet. Your hours are recorded automatically.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>Supervisors</strong> — Review exceptions instead of reconciling every timecard.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>Managers</strong> — See where crews are and how jobs flow — this week, not last month.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>Owners</strong> — Bid from real production data. Pay from verified hours. Trust the numbers.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>Ops</strong> — Schedule equipment service from actual usage, not guesswork.

        <h2 class="actual-card-title">The Truth of Work</h2>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Every record tells a story. The goal is to make it the right one.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Capture what truly happens on a job as crews move — time, movement,
          and tool proximity. Data is stored on the badge and
          uploaded in cellular batches, creating a timestamped activity stream that
          is free of edits or recollection bias.
        </p>
        <ul class="actual-card-body">
          <li>Verified start/stop per worker and crew</li>
          <li>Tool use and duration from proximity events</li>
          <li>Site entry, exit, and movement patterns by property (using tax parcels as geofences)</li>
          <li>Immutable activity stream you can take action from</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          This is the truth layer — the data you can pay from, report from, and lead from.
          When work is logged as it happens, every downstream decision starts on solid ground.

        <h2 class="actual-card-title">Reverse-Engineering</h2>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          You can't improve what you can't see flow.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Once work is captured truthfully, the next question is why it flowed the way it did.
          Actual data lets you reverse-engineer how jobs really run — where time goes, where
          constraints live, and where assumptions fall short.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body"><strong>a. Reverse-Engineered Schedule</strong></p>
        <ul class="actual-card-body">
          <li>Planned vs. actual task durations per property and route</li>
          <li>Setup, travel, and delay patterns across the day</li>
          <li>Hidden bottlenecks and repeatable flow patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="actual-card-body"><strong>b. Reverse-Engineered Estimate</strong></p>
        <ul class="actual-card-body">
          <li>Convert badge data into cost per task and parcel</li>
          <li>Ground estimating models in observed work, not guesses</li>
          <li>Continuously refine future bids and plans from real production rates</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Truth becomes improvement. The same data that powers payroll also teaches how to
          plan better — no extra steps, no separate system.

        <h2 class="actual-card-title">How It Works</h2>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>Edge Capture</strong> — The badge is an autonomous node. It captures GPS, BLE proximity, and accelerometer events at the point of work, buffers locally, and uploads over cellular in 30-minute batches. If coverage is intermittent, nothing is lost.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>Cloud Truth</strong> — Events are ingested, normalized, and bound to context: job site via geofence, equipment via tag registry. Truth intervals are written to an immutable store. Anomaly detection flags discrepancies for review.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>Downstream</strong> — Verified data flows into the systems the business already uses: payroll, job costing, scheduling, billing. Every downstream record carries its origin — the operator, the timestamp, the badge attestation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="actual-card">
        <h2 class="actual-card-title">Pricing</h2>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Hardware at commodity cost. Cloud pricing scales with your operation, not your headcount.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          You buy the hardware once — badges and tags are designed to be cheap and replaceable. The recurring cloud fee is tied to the scale of your operation: the sites you service or the crews you run. 50 badges in summer, 15 in winter? Your cloud fee adjusts with your operation. No unused licenses. No per-worker math.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>Hardware</strong> — One-time purchase. Badges at $30/unit target. Tags at $5–10/unit. You own them.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>Cloud</strong> — Monthly fee based on your operation. Includes data processing, storage, and truth store.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>Connectors</strong> — Per active integration per month. Only pay for what you connect.

        <h2 class="actual-card-title">Who This Is For</h2>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Outdoor crews that move, build, and maintain. Landscaping, construction, utilities, municipalities, solar, facilities.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Millions of U.S. field workers who currently rely on timesheets, phones, or truck GPS. Each worker is a potential badge. Each important tool is a potential tag.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          What matters most: capturing hours and tool use truthfully without extra steps — so payroll is correct, supervisors aren't chasing paperwork, and owners can trust job costing.

        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>What you get:</strong> Early access to badges and tags in live field conditions. Direct influence on the roadmap. Priority support. Preferred pricing locked in as the product scales.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          <strong>What we ask:</strong> Run Actual with your crews and equipment. Commit to regular check-ins. Provide honest input from the field.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Try it with one crew. Pay only for what that crew covers.

        <h2 class="actual-card-title">The Promise</h2>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          The badge is not a tracker — it is a witness. It does not record conversations. It does not monitor behavior. It captures the basic facts of the job: when you arrived, when you moved, when you used tools, when the day wrapped up. It only records what the work creates.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          The person doing the work should never have to prove they worked. Actual puts the truth where the work happens. You wear the badge. It records what really happened.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Simple always wins. One badge. One worker. One automatic record of the truth.
