  <!-- Two core outcomes -->
  <section class="split-section">
    <h2>Two Outcomes from the Same Truth Layer</h2>
    <div class="split-grid">
      <article>
        <h3>1. Job Activity Data — The Truth of Work</h3>
        <p>
          Automatic, parcel-aware records of who was where, when, and with which tools.
          No manual timecards. No memory bias. Just presence, motion, and proximity
          turned into trustworthy work sessions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Verified start/stop times per worker and crew</li>
          <li>Tool usage derived from BLE proximity</li>
          <li>Site entry/exit tied to tax parcels and geofences</li>
          <li>Immutable event stream ready for payroll and costing</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>2. Reverse-Engineered Schedule & Estimate — The Flow of Value</h3>
        <p>
          Use real field data to see how work actually flows across parcels — and use that
          truth to refine scheduling and estimating assumptions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Planned vs. actual durations per parcel and route</li>
          <li>Hidden constraints in setup, travel, and waiting time</li>
          <li>Production rates grounded in real labor and equipment behavior</li>
          <li>“Proof-based estimating” instead of historical guessing</li>
        </ul>

  <!-- How Actual works (short and concrete) -->
  <section class="steps">
    <h2>How Actual Works</h2>
    <ol class="steps-list">
      <li>
        <h3>1. Capture at the Edge</h3>
        <p>
          Badges measure presence, motion, and nearby equipment tags as crews move.
          Data is stored locally and uploaded in efficient batches.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>2. Anchor to Parcels</h3>
        <p>
          Cloud services attach each event to a tax parcel geofence, deriving
          <strong>WorkSessions</strong> and <strong>EquipmentSessions</strong> that reflect
          the real day on site.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>3. Turn Truth into Outcomes</h3>
        <p>
          Parcel-level truth flows into dashboards and integrations: payroll, job costing,
          estimating, and scheduling all share the same underlying reality.
        </p>
      </li>
