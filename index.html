        Capture what truly happens on a job — automatically, in the background.
        A rugged badge that logs time, movement, and tool proximity, stores it locally, and uploads
        in batches. No phones, no forms, no second guessing.

        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Every record tells a story. The goal is to make it the right one.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Capture what truly happens on a job as crews move — time, movement,
          and tool proximity. Data is stored on the badge and
          uploaded in cellular batches, creating a timestamped activity stream that
          is free of edits or recollection bias.
        </p>
        <ul class="actual-card-body">
          <li>Verified start/stop per worker and crew</li>
          <li>Tool use and duration from proximity events</li>
          <li>Site entry, exit, and movement patterns by property (using tax parcels as geofences)</li>
          <li>Immutable activity stream you can take action from</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          This is the truth layer — the data you can pay from, report from, and lead from.
          When work is logged as it happens, every downstream decision starts on solid ground.

          You can’t improve what you can’t see flow.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Once work is captured truthfully, the next question is why it flowed the way it did.
          Actual data lets you reverse-engineer how jobs really run — where time goes, where
          constraints live, and where assumptions fall short.
        </p>
        <p class="actual-card-body"><strong>a. Reverse-Engineered Schedule</strong></p>
        <ul class="actual-card-body">
          <li>Planned vs. actual task durations per property and route</li>
          <li>Setup, travel, and delay patterns across the day</li>
          <li>Hidden bottlenecks and repeatable flow patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="actual-card-body"><strong>b. Reverse-Engineered Estimate</strong></p>
        <ul class="actual-card-body">
          <li>Convert badge data into cost per task and parcel</li>
          <li>Ground estimating models in observed work, not guesses</li>
          <li>Continuously refine future bids and plans from real production rates</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="actual-card-body">
          Truth becomes improvement. The same data that powers payroll also teaches how to
          plan better — no extra steps, no separate system.
