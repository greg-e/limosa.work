# Maps of Content (MOCs)

Curated entry points to clusters of Zettels. Use these documents to outline themes, link to related notes, and surface the most important threads for a topic.

Guidelines:
- Keep links stable by referencing note IDs.
- Start each MOC with a short purpose statement and a handful of anchor links.
- Update MOCs when you add new Zettels that fit the topic.
