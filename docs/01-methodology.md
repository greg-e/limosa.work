# Methodology: Flow, Feedback, Full-Kit

## 1) Constraint → Flow (TOC)
- Find the single bottleneck that limits truth-in-time capture (usually **crew → job → attestation**).
- Exploit it (design the system so crews **only verify**; the badge does capture).
- Subordinate everything else (reporting, payroll, job costing consume the same truthful stream).
- Elevate the constraint (pilots → branch rollout → org scale).
- Repeat.

## 2) Fast Feedback (DevOps thinking)
- Short loops from **device → cloud → dashboard**.
- Ship small, test in production safely, measure adoption/accuracy, iterate.
- Telemetry first: event counts, exception rates, attestation latency, closeout success.

## 3) Full-Kit Readiness
- **Manufacturing:** BOM, test jig, firmware provisioning, labels, packaging.
- **Provisioning:** Device registry, claim/unclaim flow, QR/serial pairing, crew assignment.
- **Data:** Event schema, retention, audit log, PII boundaries.
- **Support:** RMA, battery/service lifecycle, device health dashboards.

## 4) Minimal Cognitive Load
- No app burden for crews in the field.
- Badges **passively** capture; end-of-day **attestation** is the only human step.

## 5) Success Metrics
- Payroll accuracy (+%), disputed hours (↓), auto-closed appointments (%), exception queue SLA, battery days in field.
