# Methodology: Flow, Feedback, Full-Kit

- **Constraint → Flow (TOC):** Find the choke point in time capture & payroll; design the system so crews just verify.
- **DevOps Feedback:** Short loops: device → cloud → dashboard; ship small, measure, iterate.
- **Full-Kit (readiness):** Manufacturing, provisioning, onboarding, and support “ready” before scale.
- **Minimal Cognitive Load:** No apps in the field. Badges do the work; crews attest.
