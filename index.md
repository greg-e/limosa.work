Actual is a truth system.
It replaces compliance rituals with passive flow, turns work into data without interference, and ensures payroll, job costing, and revenue recognition are accurate, automatic, and trusted.

- **Truth over compliance** Real data comes from unhampered participation, not forced reporting.
- **Flow is the goal** Every design choice is to reduce friction so that people and data move naturally.
- **Minimal interference** Technology disappears into the background; work speaks for itself.
