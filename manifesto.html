# The Actual Manifesto  
### Built for people who do the work

Every morning, crews head out before the sun comes up.  
Trucks roll, mowers start, and time moves fast. The work is real — but the records of it rarely are.

**Actual** was built for the people who keep that world running.  
For operators tired of chasing timesheets, fixing bad data, and defending work they know got done.

## 1) Truth should be automatic
If a crew shows up and does the work, proof should follow automatically — not through extra steps, apps, or guesswork.

## 2) Tools should lighten the load
Good tools make the day smoother, not busier. Actual works quietly, so your team can focus on the job, not the screen.

## 3) Every dollar should be backed by proof
When payroll runs and invoices go out, the numbers should stand on their own. No re-entry. No disputes. No second guessing.

## 4) People first, technology second
Technology should disappear into the workflow. Help the team perform, get paid, and move on to the next site.

## 5) Flow matters
Every stop in the flow costs money. Actual keeps the operation moving — from field to finance — with less friction and more confidence.

**Automatic Proof of Work.**  
Work that proves itself.
