# Platform

- Automatic timesheets derived from real movement and proximity data.
- Payroll-ready exports that match actual work instead of handwritten times.
- Job costing that ties labor and equipment time to specific jobs.
- Optional integration with field service tools (for example Salesforce Field Service) without forcing crews to use apps.
