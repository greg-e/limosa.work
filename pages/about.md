# About Actual

Actual was created to give field crews and managers a truthful picture of time and work in outdoor operations. Instead of asking crews to fight with apps and forms, Actual uses a passive badge to capture where and how long work happens.

The Bar-Tailed Godwit — a bird known for record-breaking, nonstop migrations — is the symbol for Actual: long-range endurance, efficiency, and a clear path from start to finish.

For a deeper view of the roadmap and architecture, see the internal docs under `docs/actual/` in this repository.
