# Use Cases

## Accurate Payroll

- **Problem:** Paper timesheets and manual edits create disputes and rework.
- **With Actual:** Badges record when crews actually work.
- **Outcome:** Fewer corrections, faster payroll, better trust.

## Job Costing Without Forms

- **Problem:** Supervisors guess how many hours were spent per job.
- **With Actual:** Proximity between badges, equipment tags, and job locations allocates time automatically.
- **Outcome:** Clear gross margin by job without extra data entry.

## Field Visibility and Compliance

- **Problem:** Managers cannot see where crews actually spent their day.
- **With Actual:** Location and movement patterns show real coverage.
- **Outcome:** Better route design, safety checks, and service verification.
