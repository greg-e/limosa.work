“We’re building a tool called Actual. It’s a badge workers wear and tags you put on tools. Together, they give a simple and truthful record of who worked, for how long, and with what equipment. No phones, no paperwork, no guessing.

The principle we’re working on is straightforward: if you don’t use it, you don’t invest in it. We’re not chasing outside investors — we’re looking for people in the field who see the value and want to shape it with us.

That’s where the idea of a charter partner comes in. Charter partners help fund early pilots, but more importantly, they get first access and a direct hand in making sure this works for real crews in real conditions.

The ask isn’t ‘take a gamble on us.’ It’s ‘come shape this with us, so the tool works for you from the start.’”

## Our Principle
**We keep it simple: if you don’t use it, you don’t invest in it.**  
This ensures Actual is shaped by the people who truly need it — not outside financiers chasing returns.
