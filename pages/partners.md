“We’re not looking for outside investors. We’re looking for partners in the field who see the value and want to shape the product. Charter partners help cover the cost of early pilots, get first access to the technology, and have a direct hand in making sure it works for real crews. The principle is simple: if you don’t use it, you don’t invest in it.”
