# How Actual Works

1. **Badges on every crew member**  
   Each badge logs movement and proximity to equipment, vehicles, and job locations.

2. **Cellular, not phones or gateways**  
   On a schedule (for example every 30 minutes), the badge batches encrypted telemetry over cellular. No smartphones, Wi-Fi, or local gateways are required.

3. **From raw events to decisions**  
   The platform turns events into timesheets, payroll-ready exports, job costing, and field visibility dashboards.
