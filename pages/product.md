## Product Description

### Proof as You Work
Actual places the machine at the operator. The badge captures presence, movement, and tool proximity four times per minute, storing every event with its original provenance: who created it, when it occurred, and under what conditions. Nothing is inferred or reconstructed later. There are no apps, taps, punches, or forms—only automated, verifiable evidence of work as it happens.

### Offline First, Always On
Each badge runs as an autonomous node. It records locally for days and pushes its evidence to the cloud whenever cellular signal appears. If coverage is intermittent, nothing is lost and nothing is guessed. Syncing is batch-based to preserve battery life and maintain a continuous, minute-by-minute chain of truth. Operators remain fully self-contained, and job sites require no gateways, Wi-Fi, power, or infrastructure.

### Simple Handoffs with Full Provenance
Actual’s data moves cleanly into payroll, job costing, scheduling, and equipment systems. Every downstream record still carries its origin: the operator, the timestamp, and the badge attestation. No system receives anonymous or derived data; each integration receives evidence. This reduces disputes, eliminates manual reconciliation, and makes audits straightforward.

### Job Activity Data
Actual provides verified start/stop times, presence patterns, task durations, movement on site, and tool-use intervals. The badge acts as a mechanical witness—capturing the rhythm of work without monitoring behavior. This becomes the truth layer of the business: the basis for payroll, billing, job reporting, and operational leadership.

### Reverse-Engineered Schedule and Estimate
With truthful activity data, Actual reveals how work actually flows. It identifies pacing, idle time, constraint points, return trips, and sequence patterns. This lets you reverse-engineer real cycle times, compare assumptions against field conditions, and expose where estimates and schedules drifted from reality. The system can then recommend updated durations, crew mixes, and step sequences grounded in visible flow.

### Autonomy Without Complexity
The badge operates with minimal user interaction. Indicators use light and vibration instead of screens or menus. Attestation happens at natural still points in the day—start, finish, or task boundaries—preserving operator agency without adding tasks. The architecture enforces dignity: the badge witnesses work; it does not track people.

### Designed for Flow Across the Organization
Because every record begins at the operator, flow becomes measurable from the ground up. Patterns in presence, movement, and completion form a living map of how jobs unfold. Schedulers see real cadence, estimators see actual duration shapes, and managers gain clarity without the burden of additional administrative work in the field.
