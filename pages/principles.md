1. **Automate the Constraint** — put automation where it removes the biggest bottleneck: capturing truthful presence/time.
2. **Reduce the Load** — fewer taps, fewer tools; crews shouldn’t think about data.
3. **Provenance of Truth** — every number has a clear origin from field to finance.
4. **Design for Flow** — smooth handoffs, no dead-ends.
5. **Operator First** — if it adds steps for crews, we rethink it.
