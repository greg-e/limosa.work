1. **Automate the Constraint** — remove the bottleneck of truthful presence/time capture.
2. **Reduce the Load** — fewer taps and tools for crews.
3. **Provenance of Truth** — every number has a source you can trace.
4. **Design for Flow** — smooth handoffs without rework.
5. **Operator First** — if it adds steps in the field, we rethink it.
