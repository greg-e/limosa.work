1. **Automate the constraint** — capture presence/time at the source.  
2. **Reduce the load** — fewer taps and tools for crews.  
3. **Provenance of truth** — every number is traceable.  
4. **Design for flow** — no rework at handoffs.  
5. **Operator first** — if it adds steps in the field, rethink it.
