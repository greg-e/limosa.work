# Principles of Actual

## 1. Put the Machine at the Origin  
Automation belongs where truth begins — on the operator. Every system choice prioritizes capture at the locus of work, not after the fact.

## 2. Minimize Field Burden  
Any added task, touch, or interpretation is friction. The operator’s loop stays clear; the machine handles the load.

## 3. Preserve Provenance End-to-End  
Every record carries its lineage from person to outcome. No inference substitutes for origin. No transformation breaks the chain.

## 4. Let Flow Reveal Itself  
Work patterns emerge when truth moves without obstruction. Design exposes sequence, rhythm, and constraint instead of reconstructing them.

## 5. Protect Operator Dignity  
Automation must affirm authorship, not monitor behavior. Testimony over tracking. Consent over surveillance. Truth with agency.
