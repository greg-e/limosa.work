### Why Actual exists (for landscape operators)
- **No extra steps.** Crews should work, not fill forms. 
- **Truth from the work itself.** Presence + time captured passively.
- **Right the first time.** Payroll, job costing, and revenue recognition line up because the inputs are trustworthy.

### What we promise
- **Effortless proof of work** — data captured as a byproduct of doing the job.
- **Less friction** — no check-ins, no check-outs, no phone juggling.
- **Straight-through outcomes** — from field to finance without rekeying.

> Automation is good as long as you know exactly where to put the machine. — Eliyahu M. Goldratt

We put the machine **at the source of truth**: on-site presence and time.
