## 1. Capture Provenance at the Point of Work
> When I perform work in the field, I want my activity to be captured automatically and truthfully,  
> so I can avoid filling out forms and still provide verifiable proof of work.

---

## 2. Reduce Reliance on Manual Time Tracking
> When I arrive at a job site or finish a task, I want the system to record it without needing me to take extra steps,  
> so I can stay focused on the actual work and not lose time to paperwork or apps.

---

## 3. Eliminate Dependency on Smartphones
> When I'm in the field, I want to use tools that don’t require a smartphone or app,  
> so I can do my job with fewer distractions and without technical issues.

---

## 4. Attest to Work Without Being Monitored
> When I complete a task, I want to attest to it through a trusted device,  
> so I can prove my contribution without feeling surveilled.

---

## 5. Ensure My Work Is Counted Accurately
> When I clock in, move locations, or complete tasks, I want my time and activity recorded precisely,  
> so I can trust the system will pay me accurately and recognize my effort.

---

## 6. See the Rhythm of Work Clearly
> When analyzing job data, I want to see repeatable patterns in work flow and timing,  
> so I can identify delays, optimize scheduling, and improve predictability.

---

## 7. Reveal Where Constraints Are Happening
> When reviewing operations, I want to understand where workers are waiting, repeating, or bottlenecked,  
> so I can remove friction and improve throughput.

---

## 8. Preserve Truth Across All Systems
> When data moves through systems, I want it to retain its original source and context,  
> so I can trust reports, avoid audits, and make decisions based on evidence.

---

## 9. Reduce the Administrative Burden
> When running jobs with multiple crews and sites, I want data to flow automatically from the field to payroll and costing,  
> so I can reduce the need for admin work and speed up approvals.

---

## 10. Maintain Dignity While Being Tracked
> When my presence is recorded, I want it to feel like confirmation, not control,  
> so I can feel respected by the system and confident in the record it creates.

---

## 11. Operate Independently at the Edge
> When I’m working offline or in low-signal environments, I want my tools to still function and store my activity,  
> so I don’t lose data or have to re-enter anything later.

---

## 12. Scale Truthfully Without Losing Fidelity
> When the system grows to more crews or clients, I want the data model to preserve its accuracy and traceability,  
> so that no matter how large the network gets, we can trust the outcomes.

---

## 13. Build Systems Around the Person
> When designing automation, I want the system to start from the operator's perspective,  
> so I can ensure it reflects the real flow of work and respects the people doing it.

---

## 14. Provide Immutable Records of Work
> When recording job data, I want entries to be permanent and append-only,  
> so I can be confident that no one can tamper with the record later.

---

## 15. Automate from the Origin, Not the Periphery
> When integrating automation, I want it to begin where work begins — with the person doing it,  
> so the data reflects real events, not estimates or observations.

---

## 16. Design for Simplicity and Clarity
> When using field devices, I want them to be obvious and intuitive without instructions,  
> so I don’t get distracted, slowed down, or confused by technology.

---

## 17. Ensure Automation Doesn't Replace Judgment
> When I use automated systems, I want to remain the one who affirms what’s true,  
> so I retain responsibility and control over my work.

---

## 18. Keep Workflows Resilient to Change
> When site conditions or schedules change, I want the system to adapt quickly and automatically,  
> so we don’t need to re-plan everything manually.

---

## 19. Enable System Learning from Provenance
> When we collect data from the field, I want the system to analyze it in context,  
> so it can suggest improvements based on real, verified patterns.

---

## 20. Make the Truth Visible in Flow
> When managing crews, I want to see how time, location, and task align across jobs,  
> so I can plan more accurately and remove hidden delays.

---

## 21. Preserve Agency and Autonomy
> When tools are introduced to the field, I want them to support workers without taking away their freedom,  
> so people feel empowered — not micromanaged.

---

## 22. Protect Workers From Surveillance
> When deploying technology, I want to prevent over-monitoring,  
> so workers feel trusted and systems stay focused on verification, not control.

---

## 23. Give Workers Credit for Completion
> When a task is finished, I want the system to credit the operator automatically,  
> so they get the recognition and proof they deserve.

---

## 24. Design for Trust, Not Just Compliance
> When building data systems, I want to ensure they build trust at every step,  
> so that people believe in what the data says — not just that it exists.
