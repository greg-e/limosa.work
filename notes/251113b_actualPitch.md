# The Problem Today

The way time and tool use are tracked in the field today takes a lot of effort, and it still leaves gaps.  
Paper timesheets and phone apps depend on people remembering to fill them out.  
Vehicle GPS can show where a truck went, but not what the worker did.  
The end result is that payroll and job costing take extra work, and supervisors spend too much time chasing down details.

# What Actual Is Building

Actual is creating a tool to close those gaps.

### The Badge
- Automatically logs hours and movement.  
- Displays worker ID and shift clock on an e-ink screen.  

### The Tags
- Attach to tools and equipment.  
- Link usage back to the badge so you can see who used what, and for how long.

Together, they provide a clearer record of labor and equipment use — without adding extra steps for the crew.

# What Actually Changes

Technology alone isn’t the answer. The value comes when the way people work evolves with it.

- Workers no longer fill out timesheets — they just wear the badge.  
- Supervisors stop reconciling hours and instead focus on exceptions.  
- Managers use the data during the week, not just after.  
- Owners bid with more confidence.  
- Ops teams schedule service based on real usage instead of assumptions.

# The Gains

- Cleaner, more accurate payroll  
- Supervisors recover time  
- Managers plan better  
- Equipment becomes more accountable

# The Plan

1. Prove the concept  
2. Build prototypes  
3. Run pilots with partners who use it in real field conditions  

This ensures the product grows out of real work, not assumptions.

# The Purpose

Actual isn’t meant to replace everything you do — it’s one tool to help crews and managers by giving them a truthful record they can count on.
