# The Problem Today

The way time and tool use are tracked in the field today takes a lot of effort, and it still leaves gaps.  
Paper timesheets and phone apps depend on people remembering to fill them out.  
Vehicle GPS can show where a truck went, but not what the worker did.  
The end result is that payroll and job costing take extra work, and supervisors spend too much time chasing down details.

# What Actual Is Building

Actual is creating a tool to close those gaps.

### The Badge
- Automatically logs hours and movement.  
- Displays worker ID and shift clock on an e-ink screen.  

### The Tags
- Attach to tools and equipment.  
- Link usage back to the badge so you can see who used what, and for how long.

Together, they provide a clearer record of labor and equipment use — without adding extra steps for the crew.

# What Actually Changes

Technology alone isn’t the answer. The value comes when the way people work evolves with it.

- Workers no longer fill out timesheets — they just wear the badge.  
- Supervisors stop reconciling hours and instead focus on exceptions.  
- Managers use the data during the week, not just after.  
- Owners bid with more confidence.  
- Ops teams schedule service based on real usage instead of assumptions.

# The Gains

- Cleaner, more accurate payroll  
- Supervisors recover time  
- Managers plan better  
- Equipment becomes more accountable  

---

# The Plan

1. Prove the concept  
2. Build prototypes  
3. Run pilots with partners who use it in real field conditions  

This ensures the product grows out of real work, not assumptions.

# The Purpose

Actual isn’t meant to replace everything you do — it’s one tool to help crews and managers by giving them a truthful record they can count on.

# Why the Field Needs Something Better

The way time and tool use are tracked in the field today takes more effort than it should.  
Paper timesheets and phone apps depend on workers remembering to fill them out.  
Vehicle GPS can show where a truck went, but not what the worker actually did.  
Payroll ends up cleaning up mistakes, supervisors chase down missing hours, and managers don’t get a clear view until the week is over.

# What Actual Is Building

Actual is creating a simple, truthful record of labor and tool use — without paperwork or phone apps.

### The Badge
- Automatically logs time and movement.  
- Uploads data over cellular in batches.  
- Displays worker ID and shift clock on an e-ink screen.

### The Tags
- Attach to tools and equipment.  
- When near a badge, they link usage to a specific worker and duration.

Together, the badge and tags give crews and managers a reliable picture of hours and equipment use with no extra steps in the field.

# What Actually Changes

Technology alone isn’t enough — the rules of work shift a little to create value.

- Workers stop filling out timesheets — they just wear the badge.  
- Supervisors stop reconciling hours — they review exceptions.  
- Managers adjust crews during the week because they finally have visibility.  
- Owners trust job costs.  
- Ops teams schedule service based on real use instead of assumptions.

# Three Principles That Guide Us

### 1. Focus on who wants this  
Outdoor crews in landscaping, construction, utilities, municipalities, and solar.  
Millions of U.S. workers — every one a potential badge; every important tool a potential tag.

### 2. Scale manufacturing only when it matters  
- Early runs: expensive prototypes, small batches.  
- Year three: once volumes are predictable, decide on injection molding, contract manufacturing, and supply-chain optimization.  
- Principle: learn now, scale later.

### 3. Build good data habits from the start  
- Badges log consistently (4 samples per minute), even offline.  
- Batch uploads follow a clean schema.  
- Early metrics focus on payroll accuracy, tool accountability, and safety signals.  
Strong data practices now mean we can grow without heavy overhead later.

# The Plan

1. Prove the concept  
2. Build prototypes  
3. Pilot with partners in real field conditions  
4. Expand with the people who helped shape it

# The Purpose

Actual isn’t trying to replace everything you do.  
It’s one tool to make tracking time and tools easier and more reliable.
