## 1. Principles

### Automate the Constraint
**ID:** principles-automate-the-constraint  
**Family:** Principles  
**Tagline:** Put automation where the whole job depends on it.  
**Quote:** "Fix the choke point first."

#### Why This Matters
If you automate the easy parts and ignore the bottleneck, nothing really improves. Time and presence are the real constraint for truth.

#### How It Works
- Find the actual bottleneck in the work, not the convenient one.  
- Aim automation at time and presence where they are weakest.  
- Keep judgment and exceptions in the hands of people.

#### Reflection
When you strengthen the weakest point, everything downstream gets easier.

### Convivial Tools
**ID:** principles-convivial-tools  
**Family:** Principles  
**Tagline:** Support the worker’s judgment, don’t replace it.  
**Quote:** "The tool should help, then get out of the way."

#### Why This Matters
Systems that try to think for people end up ignored. Systems that quietly support good judgment get used every day.

#### How It Works
- Automate recording, not decision-making.  
- Keep people in charge of exceptions and changes.  
- Show clear information instead of rigid rules.

#### Reflection
Tools earn trust when they extend people instead of overruling them.

### Flow Starts at the Edge
**ID:** principles-flow-starts-at-the-edge  
**Family:** Principles  
**Tagline:** Design from the field inward.  
**Quote:** "If it doesn’t work in the dirt, it doesn’t work."

#### Why This Matters
Most systems are built from the office down. Real flow happens when you start where the work happens and let the rest follow.

#### How It Works
- Observe real jobs in real conditions before designing.  
- Capture events at the edge, not in the back office.  
- Adjust office processes to match field reality, not the reverse.

#### Reflection
When the edge runs smoothly, the whole company feels it.

### Keep the Work Moving
**ID:** principles-keep-the-work-moving  
**Family:** Principles  
**Tagline:** Record the job without stopping the job.  
**Quote:** "Flow beats friction every time."

#### Why This Matters
Every time crews stop to tap or type, momentum drops. The more the system runs in the background, the more work is actually finished.

#### How It Works
- Capture time and location automatically as people move.  
- Avoid asking for data during tight or risky tasks.  
- Only interrupt crews when something truly needs attention.

#### Reflection
The best sign of good tooling is that people barely notice it while they work.

### Necessary but Not Sufficient
**ID:** principles-necessary-but-not-sufficient  
**Family:** Principles  
**Tagline:** Automation only matters if it serves the real goal.  
**Quote:** "Tech is the tool, not the change."

#### Why This Matters
New systems often get installed without fixing the real problem. Technology must support constraint, flow, and truth — not replace thinking.

#### How It Works
- Start with the business problem, not the feature list.  
- Check if automation actually improves the constraint.  
- Measure system-wide flow, not just local speed gains.

#### Reflection
A system is better when people feel more in control, not less.

### Tools for Humans
**ID:** principles-tools-for-humans  
**Family:** Principles  
**Tagline:** Fit tech to the job, not the other way around.  
**Quote:** "The tool should bend to the worker."

#### Why This Matters
If tools fight the conditions in the field, crews either ignore them or slow down. A tool that respects real work ends up actually used.

#### How It Works
- Design for gloves, dust, noise, and bad weather.  
- Remove screens and fiddly steps wherever possible.  
- Keep every interaction simple enough to do under pressure.

#### Reflection
If a tool feels like a good hammer, people reach for it without thinking.

### 395… Exactly
**ID:** principles-395-exactly  
**Family:** Principles  
**Tagline:** Exact time and place build confidence.  
**Quote:** "Count, don’t guess."

#### Why This Matters
Estimates lead to pay disputes and billing questions. Exact counts align crews, managers, and customers around what really happened.

#### How It Works
- Use the badge to measure presence, not memory.  
- Record events as they happen instead of at day’s end.  
- Let exact counts flow straight into payroll and costing.

#### Reflection
When everyone trusts the count, they can focus on the work instead of defending the numbers.

### Truth You Can Stand On
**ID:** principles-truth-you-can-stand-on  
**Family:** Principles  
**Tagline:** Make every record able to defend itself.  
**Quote:** "Truth is only truth if you can show it."

#### Why This Matters
If nobody can see where a number came from, trust disappears. Crews, finance, and customers all need proof, not just totals.

#### How It Works
- Tie each record to who was there, where, and when.  
- Capture data while work happens, not hours later.  
- Make it easy to drill from a total back to the events.

#### Reflection
When people can follow the trail, they stop fighting the numbers.
