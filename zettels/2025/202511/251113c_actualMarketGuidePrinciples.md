# How Actual Meets Our Guiding Criteria

---

## 1. Who wants our hardware, how many customers are there, and what matters most to them

**Who:**  
Outdoor labor crews — landscaping, construction, utilities, municipalities, solar, facilities.

**How many:**  
Millions of U.S. field workers who currently rely on timesheets, phones, or truck GPS.  
Each worker = one badge; each tool = one tag.

**What matters most:**  
Capturing hours and tool use truthfully without extra steps — so payroll is correct, supervisors aren’t chasing paperwork, and owners can trust job costing.

## 2. The way we manufacture mostly depends on production needs in year three

**Now (POC):**  
Dev kits and off-the-shelf parts.

**Next (Prototype):**  
Small runs, higher unit costs, good enough for pilots.

**Year Three:**  
When volumes are clear, that’s when we decide on injection molding, contract manufacturing, and supply-chain optimization.

**Principle:**  
Don’t over-engineer early. Learn fast now, scale smart later.

## 3. Good early habits with data let us do more with fewer people and scale more easily

- Every badge logs consistently (4 samples/minute), even offline.  
- Batches to the cloud are structured cleanly (CSV schema defined now).  
- Pilot metrics focus on payroll accuracy, tool accountability, and safety signals.

**Scalable habits:**  
Clear schemas, versioning practices, and telemetry health checks — so as volume grows, the data pipeline stays solid and doesn’t need rework.
