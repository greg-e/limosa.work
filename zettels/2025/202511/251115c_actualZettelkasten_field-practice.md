## 2. Field Practice

### Context Without Effort
**ID:** field-practice-context-without-effort  
**Family:** Field Practice  
**Tagline:** Let place and tags set the paperwork.  
**Quote:** "The system should already know the job."

#### Why This Matters
Picking job codes and tasks by hand slows crews and adds mistakes. Context should come from where you are and what you’re near.

#### How It Works
- Map locations to sites and parcels ahead of time.  
- Use tags on equipment and zones to clarify work.  
- Only ask people to choose when there is real ambiguity.

#### Reflection
When the system understands the site, workers can focus on the work instead of the form.

### Effortless Proof
**ID:** field-practice-effortless-proof  
**Family:** Field Practice  
**Tagline:** Let time and place record automatically.  
**Quote:** "The work proves itself."

#### Why This Matters
Clearing up missing or wrong time records costs hours. When proof is captured as crews move, there is nothing to chase later.

#### How It Works
- Start tracking when a worker arrives on site.  
- Tie time records to actual locations, not just job names.  
- Keep storing events even when the signal drops.

#### Reflection
Good records feel like a side effect of doing the job right, not a second job.

### Get Paid Right
**ID:** field-practice-get-paid-right  
**Family:** Field Practice  
**Tagline:** Let clean records protect both crew and company.  
**Quote:** "Pay should match the work, every time."

#### Why This Matters
Nothing damages trust faster than a short paycheck. When records are solid, both sides can see and fix problems quickly.

#### How It Works
- Match each hour on the check to a site and job.  
- Show workers their own time history clearly.  
- Lock records once both sides have agreed.

#### Reflection
Reliable pay builds crews that stay instead of crews that leave.

### Know the Truth On Site
**ID:** field-practice-know-the-truth-on-site  
**Family:** Field Practice  
**Tagline:** Give foremen live, simple facts.  
**Quote:** "Don’t wait until tomorrow to know today."

#### Why This Matters
If supervisors only see yesterday’s report, they can’t fix today’s problems. They need clear status while crews are still on site.

#### How It Works
- Show who is on which site right now.  
- Highlight crews that started late or left early.  
- Flag areas with unusual idle time for review.

#### Reflection
When leaders see reality in time, small adjustments prevent big issues.

### Less Admin, More Work
**ID:** field-practice-less-admin-more-work  
**Family:** Field Practice  
**Tagline:** Strip away busywork from the field.  
**Quote:** "Crews are hired to build, not to type."

#### Why This Matters
Time spent filling forms and correcting time is time not spent producing value.

#### How It Works
- Remove manual time sheets where possible.  
- Use badge data as the first source of truth.  
- Reserve human input for real exceptions.

#### Reflection
When admin drops, output and morale rise together.

### One Badge, Whole Day
**ID:** field-practice-one-badge-whole-day  
**Family:** Field Practice  
**Tagline:** Make the badge the only touchpoint.  
**Quote:** "Carry one thing and forget about it."

#### Why This Matters
Phones, apps, and terminals all compete for attention. One simple badge that just works is easier to carry and easier to trust.

#### How It Works
- Avoid depending on phones or on-site terminals.  
- Let the badge cover the entire shift from start to finish.  
- Design so crews rarely need to touch or think about it.

#### Reflection
The more the badge fades into the background, the more useful it becomes.

### Presence Becomes Proof
**ID:** field-practice-presence-becomes-proof  
**Family:** Field Practice  
**Tagline:** Turn normal movement into evidence of work.  
**Quote:** "Being there creates the record."

#### Why This Matters
Manual check-ins create gaps and disputes. Continuous presence at a site is the simplest signal that work could happen.

#### How It Works
- Use location as the base signal for time.  
- Treat leaving the site as the natural stop time.  
- Flag odd patterns for review instead of blocking work.

#### Reflection
When just being on site generates proof, good behavior becomes the easiest behavior.

### Proof Without Training
**ID:** field-practice-proof-without-training  
**Family:** Field Practice  
**Tagline:** Make usage obvious at a glance.  
**Quote:** "If you need a manual, it’s too complex."

#### Why This Matters
New tools often stall because training never reaches everyone. Field tools must make sense from day one.

#### How It Works
- Keep physical interactions to one or two gestures.  
- Use simple light or vibration cues instead of menus.  
- Test with new hires who have never seen it before.

#### Reflection
When people understand a tool in seconds, adoption takes care of itself.
