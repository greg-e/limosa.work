# Applying Self-Determination Theory to Actual

## 1. The Challenge with Guided Motivation (Extrinsic)

When crews feel **“I should clock in/out because the company said so,”** motivation is **guided** and external.  
This creates short-term compliance but low sustainability.

**Characteristics:**
- Behavior: one-off or inconsistent
- Requires: incentives, monitoring, or enforcement
- Risk: high friction, resistance (“another app,” “extra work”)

**Result:**  
Compliance by force → low engagement → poor data quality.

## 2. The Opportunity with Self-Directed Motivation (Intrinsic)

When crews say **“It’s important to me to…”**, motivation becomes **self-directed**.  
Behavior becomes sustainable because it aligns with personal value.

**Crew motivations include:**
- Getting paid fairly and accurately  
- Avoiding disputes or corrections  
- Simplifying their day (less paperwork)  
- Trusting the system to reflect reality

**Result:**  
Adoption by choice → consistent participation → accurate truth flow.

## 3. Transition of Motivation

| Phase | Phrase | Type | Behavior | Requirement |
|-------|---------|------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | “Alex said I should do it” | Guided | One-time compliance | External incentive |
| 2 | “Doing it feels great!” | Self-Directed | Sustained engagement | Internal satisfaction |

Actual bridges this gap by **making truth effortless and rewarding**.

## 4. How Actual Enables Intrinsic Motivation

### a. System Design
- **Passive Capture:** No check-ins or manual actions; removes friction.  
- **Feedback Loop:** Visible confirmation (on [,,]) creates instant “feels great” moment.  
- **Trustworthy Outcomes:** Crews see that the system *pays them accurately* and *represents them truthfully.*

### b. Messaging & Positioning
- **From:** “You must clock in so we can track payroll.”  
- **To:** “The badge makes sure you get paid right, every time.”  
- Emphasize *personal benefit over corporate requirement.*

### c. Rollout Strategy
- Identify early adopters as **champions** who experience fairness and ease.  
- Share real crew stories to spread intrinsic buy-in.  
- Shift narrative from **compliance** → **ownership.**

## 5. Strategic Implication for Actual

Actual isn’t just automating data capture — it’s **automating trust**.

| Old Model | New Model |
|------------|------------|
| Compliance-driven | Participation-driven |
| Incentive-dependent | Value-aligned |
| Manual validation | Natural truth emergence |

This aligns with Actual’s principle:  
> “Truth doesn’t need supervision.”

By embedding **Self-Determination Theory** into product, rollout, and messaging, Actual builds lasting adoption — not because users *should* use it, but because they *want* to.
