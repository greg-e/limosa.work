## Conviviality
Conviviality, from Ivan Illich’s *Tools for Conviviality*, is the idea that technology should liberate human autonomy and creativity rather than enslave it. Convivial tools are those that extend people’s capabilities without demanding obedience to a system.  

In the context of Actual, this principle appears in the emphasis on minimal cognitive load, passive data capture, and operator-first design—the badge serves the worker, not the other way around.

## Provenance  
Provenance is about truthful origin—the verifiable chain of creation, context, and stewardship behind data or artifacts.  

Within Actual, provenance anchors trust: every time-and-location record has a clear, auditable lineage. Nothing is abstracted beyond recognition, and accountability is built into the system’s architecture.
