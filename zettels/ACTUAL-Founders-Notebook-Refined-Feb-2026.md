# ACTUAL  
## Proof of Work  
### Founder’s Notebook — Refined  
**From Vision to Working Prototype: A Practical Plan**  
**February 2026 | limosa.work**

---

## What Changed in This Version

- Removed philosophical framing that obscured execution.
- Replaced per-device consumption pricing with **operation-based pricing**.
- Mapped **12 JTBD** directly to architecture and proof-of-value metrics.
- Identified **specific help required** at each phase.
- Scoped realistically to **prototype or pilot within 12 months**.
- Converted intent into **actions executable this month**.

---

# 1. Honest Assessment

## Real Assets

- 15+ years landscape domain expertise.
- Business analyst capability in **data, workflow, and systems**.
- Tight core concept: **badge + BLE + cellular + operation pricing**.
- Structured **JTBD → architecture → metrics** mapping.
- Proven prototyping base: **Blues Wireless Notecard**.
- Correct removal of **biometrics** (cost, legal, complexity).

## Critical Gaps

- No **embedded firmware engineer**.
- No **backend/cloud engineer**.
- No **working badge hardware**.
- No **charter partner commitment**.
- No **validated pricing**.

These are existential, not cosmetic.

## Prior Failure Mode

Philosophy was treated as **engineering requirement**.  
Correct model:

- **Principles → decision filters**
- **Specifications → measurable requirements**

---

# 2. Product Definition (Plain)

**Actual** is a hardware + cloud system that passively captures:

- **Time**
- **Location**
- **Tool presence**

No manual entry.  
Feeds payroll, costing, billing, scheduling.

---

## Badge Capabilities

- GPS, accelerometer, BLE scans **4×/minute**.
- Local buffering → **cellular batch upload**.
- Offline-first. No phone, Wi-Fi, or gateway.
- Supervisor identity assignment. No biometrics.
- **7-day battery target**.
- **$30 production cost target**.

## BLE Tags

- Broadcast unique ID.
- Enable **automatic equipment usage logging**.
- **$5–10 target cost**.

## Cloud Responsibilities

- Idempotent ingestion + normalization.
- Site binding via **parcel geofence**.
- Immutable **truth intervals**.
- APIs to payroll/ERP/scheduling.
- **Anomaly flagging**, not auto-correction.

---

# 3. Pricing Model — Operation-Based

## Core Principle

Do **not** price per user, badge, or tag.  
Price the **operation served**.

Otherwise this collapses into disguised SaaS seat pricing.

---

## Structure

| Component | Unit | Logic |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Badge hardware | One-time | Commodity device |
| Tag hardware | One-time | Commodity beacon |
| Cloud platform | **Per active site/crew/month** | Core revenue |
| Connectors | Per integration/month | Pay only when used |
| Insights (future) | Report/dashboard tier | Analytics value |

---

## Validation Questions

- What rate beats **manual timesheet labor cost**?
- What is the **minimum viable monthly floor**?
- Best unit: **site, crew, or event volume**?
- Enterprise **flat-rate threshold**?
- Hardware perceived as **asset vs lease**?

Only pilots answer these.

# 4. JTBD Grounded to Reality

### Prototype-Critical Jobs

**02, 03, 04, 06 only matter initially.**

If these fail, everything fails.

| # | Job | Phase | Metric |
|---|-----|-------|--------|
| 02 | Passive capture | Prototype | <2 min/day interaction |
| 03 | Edge automation | Prototype | Error reduction |
| 04 | Truth preservation | Prototype | Near-zero loss |
| 06 | Tool detection | Prototype | ≥90% encounters |

All others depend on these.

---

# 5. Practical Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Business Foundation (Months 1–2)

**Exit:** legal entity + provisional patent.

Budget: **$3K–5K**

---

## Phase 2 — Hardware Prototype (Months 2–6)

**Exit:**  
5 badges running **72+ hours** with GPS + BLE + upload.

Budget: **$6K–17K**

### Critical Truth

Without firmware engineer → **no prototype**.

---

## Phase 3 — Cloud MVP (Months 4–8)

**Exit:**  
Badge events visible in dashboard **within 30 minutes**.

Budget: **$2K–5K**

Use your **Power BI + data skills**.  
Contract only **ingestion + storage**.

---

## Phase 4 — Charter Partner Pilot (Months 6–12)

**Exit:**  

- 30-day live pilot  
- >90% event completeness  
- <2 min/day crew interaction  
- Partner says **“I would pay.”**

Budget: **$1.7K–3.3K**

---

# 6. Required Help

| Role | When | Budget |
|------|------|--------|
| Business attorney | Month 1 | $500–1.5K |
| Patent attorney | Month 1–2 | $2K–4K |
| **Firmware engineer** | Months 2–6 | **$5K–15K** |
| Backend developer | Months 4–8 | $2K–5K |
| Industrial designer (opt.) | Month 4–6 | $1K–3K |

Everything else → **you**.

---

# 7. Total Cost to Pilot

| Phase | Low | High |
|-------|-----|------|
| Business | $3K | $5K |
| Hardware | $6K | $17K |
| Cloud | $2K | $5K |
| Pilot | $1.7K | $3.3K |
| Hosting (year) | $600 | $1.2K |

## Total: **$13.3K – $31.5K**

Achievable self-funded.

Stopping at **prototype** is still a **fundable asset**.

---

# 8. Architecture Overview

**Edge → Cloud → Truth → Consumer**

### Prototype Scope

- Edge capture working.
- Basic ingestion + storage.
- Power BI visibility.

### Pilot Adds

- Geofencing.
- Tag binding.
- First connector.

---

# 9. Real Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Reality |
|------|------------|---------|
| No firmware engineer | High | Project stops |
| Battery <7 days | Medium | Adoption fails |
| GPS accuracy limits | Medium | Requires buffers/BLE anchors |
| No charter partner | Medium | No validation |
| Scope creep | High | Time + money burn |
| Founder burnout | Medium-High | Must contract engineering |

These are the real failure modes.

---

# 10. Role of Philosophy

## Useful

- Trade-off filter  
- Sales narrative  
- Product guardrails  
- Hiring lens  

## Harmful (removed)

- Philosophy as specs  
- Card-phase theater  
- Manifesto padding  
- 30-month fantasy timeline  

Now philosophy **serves execution**.

---

# 11. Next 30 Days

**Priority order:**

1. Form Georgia LLC  
2. Post firmware contract role  
3. Order Notecard kits  
4. Order BLE tags  
5. Write firmware spec  
6. Call 3 industry contacts  
7. File provisional patent  
8. Stand up Notehub → cloud route  

## Single Most Important Action

**Find the firmware engineer.**  
Everything else is secondary.

---

# 12. Success Criteria

## Prototype Gate

- 5 badges run **72+ hours**
- GPS within **15 m**
- BLE detection **>85%**
- Upload success **>95%**
- Battery meets runtime target

## Cloud Gate

- Data visible **<30 min**

## Pilot Gate

- >90% completeness  
- <2 min/day interaction  
- Partner agrees to **pay**  
- **>30% margin** at real pricing  

Binary outcomes. No ambiguity.

---

**End State:**  
Philosophy remains — but now it is **operational**.  
Execution path is **finite, funded, and measurable**.

Proceed to firmware hire.
