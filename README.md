# Language

*defines the vocabulary of Actual — the words that describe how provenance, locus, and conviviality connect technology and person.*

## Card 1 – The locus of automation
**Front**  
**Definition:** *locus* → the point where something originates.  
**Purpose:** Describe where automation truly resides.  
**Insight:** Conventional systems focus *on* people; Actual emanates *from* them.  
**Practice:** Each badge event begins at the person — the locus of provenance — and carries that origin through every connected system.  
**Sketch area:** Person at center, arrows radiating outward.

***

**Back**  
**Source:** Classical Latin *locus*; systems theory and philosophy.  
**Context:** “Locus” refers to origin, not observation.  
**Applied to Actual:** Automation has a moral and operational center: the person. Every record retains its line of origin.

---

## Card 2 – Provenance
**Front**  
**Definition:** *provenance* → the record of origin, custody, and transformation of a thing.  
**Purpose:** Anchor Actual’s integrity in traceable origin.

**Sketch area:** Chain linking person → badge → cloud → system.

***

**Back**  
**Source:** Archival science and authentication disciplines.  
**Context:** Provenance guarantees authenticity by maintaining traceable origin.

---

## Card 3 – Conviviality
**Front**  
**Definition:** *convivial* → a tool that empowers its user instead of controlling them.  
**Purpose:** Keep automation humane and autonomous.  
**Insight:** Ivan Illich defined convivial tools as those offering maximum control with minimal dependence.

# Automation

*explores how automation originates at the person — the locus of provenance — where technology becomes an extension of truth, not a replacement for it.*

## Card 1 – Automation is good as long as you know exactly where to put the machine
**Front**  
**Definition:** *placement* → deliberate choice of where automation belongs.

---

## Card 2 – The provenance placement
**Front**  
**Definition:** Automation positioned where truth originates.  
**Purpose:** Contrast collection with creation of data.  
**Insight:** Other systems automate observation; Actual automates origin.  
**Practice:** The badge records verifiable evidence at the moment of action, turning each event into trustworthy truth.

## Card 3 – The badge as witness
**Front**  
**Definition:** *witness* → one who provides verified testimony.  
**Purpose:** Redefine the device as a companion in truth, not surveillance.  
**Insight:** Observation without consent is control; witnessing affirms authorship.  
**Practice:** The badge attests to time, place, and completion automatically, serving as mechanical witness for the operator.  
**Sketch area:** Person and badge linked by a line labeled “witness of work.”

***

**Back**

**Definition:** *adaptive flow* → movement that reshapes itself to preserve provenance with minimal resistance.  
**Purpose:** Describe continuous improvement through structural learning.  
**Insight:** Flow must adapt faster than friction evolves.  
**Practice:** Actual compares historical and live data to identify emerging obstructions, updating schedules and patterns automatically.  
**Sketch area:** Two paths—old blocked, new open.

***

**Back**  
**Source:** Constructal Law of design evolution.  
**Context:** Systems survive by adjusting flow pathways.  
**Applied to Actual:** Adaptive flow keeps automation alive—data learns the easiest truthful path.

---

## Card 5 – The still point
**Front**  
**Definition:** *still point* → the moment where flow pauses long enough for truth to settle.  
**Purpose:** Highlight that pause and reflection sustain continuous flow.  
**Insight:** Without stillness, patterns blur; without motion, they decay.  
**Practice:** Actual uses attestation points—end-of-day closures—to synchronize rhythm and renew fidelity.  
**Sketch area:** Circular flow with marked rest node.

***

**Back**  
**Source:** Process theory and Goldratt’s cycle of focus.  
**Context:** Reflection prevents drift from purpose.  
**Applied to Actual:** Each attestation is a still point—the act of re-anchoring flow in truth.

# Conviviality

*examines how Actual’s tools preserve agency, dignity, and autonomy — making technology an extension of the person rather than their overseer.*

## Card 1 – Tools that serve
**Front**  
**Definition:** *convivial tool* → one that enhances capability without dependency.  
**Purpose:** Frame design ethics for automation.

# Design Principles

*defines how Actual learns, scales, and remains truthful — translating provenance into architecture.*

## Card 1 – Design for provenance
**Front**  
**Definition:** *provenance-first design* → building systems around verifiable origin.  
**Purpose:** Make origin a design invariant.

**Context:** Traceability prevents corruption.  
**Applied to Actual:** Provenance-first design ensures that scale never erodes authenticity.

---

## Card 2 – Architecture of learning
**Front**  
**Definition:** *learning architecture* → a system that improves by observing its own provenance.

## Card 3 – Scale without distortion
**Front**  
**Definition:** *scalable truth* → growth that preserves fidelity.  
**Purpose:** Ensure expansion doesn’t dilute integrity.  
**Insight:** Most systems lose accuracy as they grow; provenance preserves it.  
**Practice:** Actual’s distributed edge model scales by replication, not abstraction—each new node remains a source of truth.  
**Sketch area:** Network expanding outward, each node identical.

***

**Back**  
**Source:** Systems engineering and Constructal scaling.  
**Context:** Good design scales shape, not strain.  
**Applied to Actual:** Growth through repetition of truthful units—precision multiplied, not averaged.

---

## Card 4 – Moral engineering
**Front**  
**Definition:** *moral engineering* → designing systems that make the right thing the easy thing.  
**Purpose:** Connect ethics to practicality.  
**Insight:** Every design decision expresses a value; neutrality is fiction.  
**Practice:** Actual encodes transparency, auditability, and provenance so integrity happens by default.  
**Sketch area:** Circuit labeled “integrity = default.”

***

**Back**  
**Source:** Ethical design and Goldratt’s Rules of Flow.  
**Context:** Systems shape behavior more than policy does.  
**Applied to Actual:** By moral design, Actual ensures that honesty requires no extra effort—truth flows naturally.

**Source:** Reinertsen’s flow economics and Illich’s simplicity ethic.  
**Context:** Simplicity sustains adaptability.  
**Applied to Actual:** The simplest path is the most truthful one—clarity as engineering discipline.

# Closing Reflection – The Unbroken Thread

*Everything in Actual begins and ends with provenance — the person as origin, the system as witness, and truth as continuity.*

In most automation, data moves faster than understanding.  
Speed becomes the goal, precision the casualty, and trust a hopeful assumption.  
Actual reverses this logic.

Each badge, each attestation, each line of record is not data collected — it is **truth declared**.  
Automation here is not surveillance but stewardship: a machine placed exactly where it restores flow, autonomy, and dignity.  
The system learns not to predict behavior but to remember provenance.

When flow aligns with provenance, geometry becomes moral.  
Work gains shape; time gains proof; technology gains humility.  
The badge, the operator, the network, and the organization form a single, transparent circuit of accountability.


This is the unbroken thread of Actual:  
automation with origin,  
truth with lineage,  
design with conscience.
